#### Features to Add to Individual Portfolio Items

If there’s one thing you can take away from this article, it’s that your portfolio isn’t the only thing that should be featured on your website. It is, however, important, so let’s go over a few of the things you should add to individual portfolio items (i.e., the individual pages you dedicate to individual projects/jobs you’ve worked on):

#### Projects

#### More High-Quality Images

- Your best image from a project should represent it in your portfolio, but you should also add more high-quality images to its individual page.
- Overview – Write a brief description about the project, specifically the task you were assigned, how you accomplished it and what the result was.
  More Information – Once you have a brief description completed, add more information for those who may be interested. It’s especially important for you to discuss any obstacles you faced while completing the project and how you overcame them. If you learned new information while completing the project, be sure to include that as well.

#### Testimonial

- This ties into the point I made about featuring testimonials on the homepage. Your best testimonials should be saved for the homepage, but you can feature every testimonial you receive on the project’s individual page.

## My answers to the interview

What’s in my backpack? :school_satchel:
I am a mature professional eager to grow in ITC sector.
During my first study in Travel and Tourism Business Management. I had the chance to fill my backpack with some travelling experiences. The unique experience of managing a B&B in Venezia and enjoying the Art and Italian culture is one that I will never forget.
I learned to look at people from a different perspective and found my passion for people With that passion, I decided to study Political sciences where I could understand society not just as a travel point of view, but my views are more in detail.
With that backpack, I traveled everywhere I was fortunate to have a scholarship to study at the American University in Cairo, Egypt where I completed my thesis.
The side pockets of my backpack are filled with social and educational moments gained from being involved in activities with movements such as (Oxfam,Red Cross, … ) and hobbies (gardening, horse riding making my own bio organic cosmetics).
I stuffed my backpack with various jobs experiences, here in Belgium I worked for major retail companies such as Mercedez benz, Rituals and Louis Vuitton.
But I am not stopping there, I still have a little bit of space left to hopefully put my Webdesign programme. While the people give me some last-minute treats to take on my journey, I am looking forward to what the big world has to offer when I am done packing.
I want my website in two colours light and soft.
I want my website very simple and user friendly.
I want a photo and contact details with my cv CLEAR on top of the page. No photos.
I would like to have all my projects easy to find and the testimonies.
I want that the programmes I have studied to be easy to read in logos.

I want a call on action button only for potential clients
