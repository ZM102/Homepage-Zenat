Do you want small blog posts of similar thing to express your ideas ?
10. A High-Quality Image of Yourself
This is optional, but it may help clients connect with you better if you share a picture of yourself on your website. Unless everything you post is highly professional, I wouldn’t insert your Instagram feed on your site. Instead, opt for a high-quality image, and place it on your homepage, About page or both.

11. Relevant Social Media Accounts
Speaking of Instagram, if you use any of your social media accounts professionally, be sure to include it on your site. Not only is it another form of marketing, it can also provide yet another way for you to look like an authority in your niche.

12. Relevant Personal Projects
do you want to show your previous project? a limited number or all, will they be grouped?

13. A FAQ Section
As you freelance more and more and go through negotiations with new and potential clients, you’ll probably notice the same questions and concerns popping up every now and again. A FAQ section is a great place to address these questions and concerns, and it can even cut back on the number of questions and comments you receive from potential clients.
Do you want FAQ section or will it be committed   with describing your self section?
Features to Add to Individual Portfolio Items
If there’s one thing you can take away from this article, it’s that your portfolio isn’t the only thing that should be featured on your website. It is, however, important, so let’s go over a few of the things you should add to individual portfolio items (i.e., the individual pages you dedicate to individual projects/jobs you’ve worked on):
Projects
More High-Quality Images – Your best image from a project should represent it in your portfolio, but you should also add more high-quality images to its individual page.
Overview – Write a brief description about the project, specifically the task you were assigned, how you accomplished it and what the result was.
More Information – Once you have a brief description completed, add more information for those who may be interested. It’s especially important for you to discuss any obstacles you faced while completing the project and how you overcame them. If you learned new information while completing the project, be sure to include that as well.
Testimonial – This ties into the point I made about featuring testimonials on the homepage. Your best testimonials should be saved for the homepage, but you can feature every testimonial you receive on the project’s individual page.
